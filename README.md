This project is the source code for our tutorial: [how to get checkable rows within a custom ListView][1]

Android's ListView is a useful component that can allow the user to check items natively. Two SDK samples ([List 10][2] 
and [List 11][3]) show you how to accomplish this using simple CheckedTextView widgets to represent the rows. However, 
when you want to represent the rows using a custom layout, you'll need some time to figure out why you items do not get 
checked.Well, by the end of this tutorial you should know how to do it.
